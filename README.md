<h3>News Summarizer and Sentiment Detector</h3>
<p>I created this Python app with the help of Youtube tutorials, ChapGPT, online resources, and valuable insights of more experienced friends! It summarizes the content and sentiment of news articles entered by the user. The application uses the TextBlob and newspaper libraries for natural language processing and article scraping, and the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface.</p>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<li>Python</li>
<li>TextBlob</li>
<li>newspaper</li>
<li>tkinter</li>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Multi-article summarization: The application currently only allows the user to summarize one article at a time. In future iterations, the application could be expanded to support batch processing of multiple articles.<p>
<p>More detailed sentiment analysis: The application currently only provides a basic sentiment analysis. In future iterations, more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques could be used to provide a more detailed analysis of the article's sentiment.</p>
